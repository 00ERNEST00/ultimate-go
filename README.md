## Design Philosophy

- Does your performance better? Is it your highest priority?
- Performance vs Productivity?
- Trade-off? Everything comes with a cost
- Optimize for correctness first, then think about performance
- Code Reviews
- Integrity:
  - Be serious about writing code that reliable
  - Less code means less bugs
  - Error handling must be a part of the main code
- Readability:
  - Not hiding the cost of the code or the decision making, the impact
- Simplicity:
  - Hide complexity
- Performance:
  - Compute less
  - Never guess
  - Measurements must be relevant
  - Profile
  - Test

## Language Syntax

- [Variables](variables.go)
